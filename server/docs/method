These are not actually methods its just for triggers which will trigger continuous communication without any interption by other things.
when any one these triggered others things will work but will have very low priority.
I'm not sure on using these actually but maybe their will need for these in future.

Well, now real methods since, their will be different type of requests so, its better to let different functions handle it in different ways.

Lets, categorise the requests.

1. public-data
    -> When client requests for any publicly available data, what server have.

2. update
    -> When client requests server for any updates on publicly-available data.

3. connect
    -> help users for creating a connection

4. send
    -> when someone wants to send some file to the server or directly to the client
